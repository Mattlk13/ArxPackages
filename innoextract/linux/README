# Inno Extract - A tool to unpack installers created by Inno Setup

Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) is a tool to create installers
for Microsoft Windows applications. Inno Extracts allows to extract such
installers under non-windows systems without running the actual installer using
wine. Inno Extract currently supports installers created by Inno Setup 1.2.10 to
5.5.0.

Inno Extract is available under the ZLIB license - see the LICENSE file.

## Run

To extract a setup file to the current directory run:

    $ ./innoextract <file>

A list of available options can be retrieved using

    $ ./innoextract --help

Documentation is also available as a man page:

    $ man man/innoextract.1.gz

## Limitations

* Inno Extract currently only supports extracting all the data. There is no
  support for extracting individual files or components and limited support for
  extracting language-specific files.

* Included scripts and checks are not executed.

* Data is always extracted to the current directory and the mapping from Inno
  Setup variables like the application directory to subdirectories is
  hard-coded.

* Inno Extract does not check if an installer includes multiple files with the
  same name and will continually overwrite the destination file when extracting.

* Names for data files in multi-file installers must follow the standard naming
  scheme.

* Encrypted installers are not supported.

A perhaps more complete, but Windows-only, tool to extract Inno Setup files is
innounp (http://innounp.sourceforge.net/).

Extracting windows installer executables created by programs other than Inno
Setup is out of the scope of this project. Some of these can be unpacked by the
following programs:

* cabextract: http://www.cabextract.org.uk/

* unshield: http://www.synce.org/oldwiki/index.php/Unshield
