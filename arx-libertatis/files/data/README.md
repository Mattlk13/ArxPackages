## Arx Fatalis data files

Copy the data (.pak files and misc and/or grap directories) from a fully patched Arx Fatalis 1.21 install into this directory to use them with `arx` and `arx-portable`.

Be sure to rename them to lower case though.
Or just use the `arx-install-data` script - simply run/click it and follow the GUI.
